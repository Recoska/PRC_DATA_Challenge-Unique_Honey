## Introduction

This is the repository for the PRC Data Challenge 2025 and includes the additional data and code for generating the final data and the ML model needed and used for the fuel consumption prediction for reproducing the results. In Additional Data all openly available data is included and explained. We have basically two main processes. The first process is how the final dataset for predicting is generated, see Data Generation and how the model is trained, see Model Training. Requirements displays all the libraries needed for starting the pipelines. All code is written using .ipynb files - Jupyter notebook.

## Additional Data

## Contributors

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification and is brought to you by these [awesome contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Model Training

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))
